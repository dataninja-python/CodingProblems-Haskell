# CodingProblems-Haskell
Using mathematics, data science, and computer science to solve various challenges from different sources using Haskell...because I'm hoping to use it in production one day.


# What Is This
After years as a startup founder and forced software engineer, I am great at:
  (a) creating software to solve my own problems
  (b) getting good at building products to solve other people's problems
But feel like I would be not much better than a jr. software developer in a competitive coding challenge.

My ego won't accept this. So, this repository will collect problems and solutions to challenges from around the web.

# Why It Matters
  1. Unless you like solving problems for fun, you might want to move on.
  2. While I've become an effective software engineer, I want to be more efficient. Being forced to focus on data structures and algorithms should help.
  3. Come on. You know you were excited when you saw I was using Haskell. I like Haskell and functional programming. Unfortunately, I don't use it enough to git gud.
  4. Going to fix the above. Follow along and maybe you will learn to like Haskell too.
  5. Sharing what I learn with the world. In case other people want to use Haskell in coding challenges.
